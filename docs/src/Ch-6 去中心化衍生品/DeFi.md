# PART 2: DECENTRALISED FINANCE

# Chapter 14: Economics of Decentralised Finance (DeFi)

Decentralised finance (DeFi) is the current trend in the token economics space. In general, the goal of DLT is to remove intermediaries. One of the sectors populated with many intermediaries is the financial sector. There are plenty of intermediaries in the space, from brokers to traders, relationship managers, and funds.

Tokenisation brings about the possibility of codifying the majority of the business logics and executing them with machines (aka smart contracts). This frees up the margin (aka money) rewarded to intermediaries which can then be distributed to reward users in the system.

Decentralised finance is important because it has the potential to revolutionise the traditional financial sector as we know it in the following ways:

- Perhaps money can be managed by codifying monetary policy in machines, algorithms and smart contracts. Money can then be neutral1, without any political ties and agenda.

- Or allowing trade with assets (e.g. tokens) without having a counterparty orderbook, because machines will always be the counterparty, providing liquidity.

Maybe it is a constant rebalancing of your financial portfolio based on the exposure you are interested in, and the machine rebalances it automatically without having to pay your portfolio manager the high management fees.

The possibilities are endless because there are huge inefficiencies in the market. As we bring the systems into a digital space, we are making the system more efficient – better, faster, quicker. Hence, it is important to understand the economics and design of these DeFi math and systems infrastructure that we are building. Applications like portfolio management, decentralised exchange and decentralised insurance can exist on a codified business logic form.

## 14.1 Introduction to DeFi

### 14.1.1. What is DeFi

DeFi is a movement that uses decentralised networks to transform the financial system as we know it, by removing the intermediaries.

This means taking the existing financial systems (like NASDAQ exchange, portfolio managers, hedge funds) and building them on new systems.

New governance, new incentives, new mechanisms. A whole new world.

Similar to traditional companies, a DeFi protocol also includes the usual Assets, Liabilities and Equities in the balance sheet. The difference is that instead of laws and regulations defined by the government the company is incorporated in, DeFi protocols define the rules that users and tokens have to follow.

The rules are everything we have discussed in the first half of the book. A DeFi protocol operates like a traditional company but is structured in a new and innovative way.

We discussed the difference between tangible and intangible assets in Section 2.2.3. That discussion is around economics.

This second half of the book is around DeFi. And that is what we will focus on. The innovative ways of crowdsourcing liquidity (debt) and distribute ownership of the protocol to the community (equity).

This is what DeFi is about. Removing intermediaries and distributing value-add to users of the system, instead of only to shareholders with sufficient capital to begin with.

The underlying principles of a traditional company exists in DeFi. The mechanism to apply the principles are different, primarily focusing on decentralisation.

## 14.1.2. Why DeFi?

Before we move into the details of “how the whole DeFi thing works”, it is important to start with “Why”. The existing financial system, infrastructure and products have been in place for years. Despite the various financial crises, the economy is still surviving. So, why do we need DeFi?

Simple. Because the existing system is inefficient, and incentives are not distributed equally. That means people at the top of the value-chain are earning so much, while others at the bottom are struggling to pay for their meals. Or that intermediaries (aka the intermediaries) are earning so much when we can codify this business logic with machines. Or that money is not neutral and tied to political agendas. This only hurts those at the bottom of the value-chain.

So, there are ways to increase efficiency in the system. And we can do this by building them on a decentralised finance infrastructure. How? On to the next point.

## 14.1.3 How does DeFi Work

1. DeFi is about removing intermediaries

The way to do it is to codify business logic.

For example, instead of having a centralised orderbook to match sellers and buyers on an exchange (e.g. New York Stock Exchange), you can use machines to be the counterparty to trade with. These machines will always follow the code, and the code is defined by math. In the exchange of an exchange, it uses the formula found in physics, the energy conservation theory.

In that sense, math is the underlying foundation that defines the infrastructure of DeFi. Code is the language that computers will be processing the math and information.

DeFi is like building a tall skyscraper. Math is the foundational pillars and bricks. Code is the cement.


2. Distributing governance to peers.

Removing intermediaries and executing business logic with machines is powerful. The next powerful thing is to solve, or reduce inefficiencies, in governance.

Governance and corporate governance are huge problems. Both in the “real” physical world and the online digital world. Coates (2018) highlighted that passive indexing, private equity and globalisation is reshaping the idea of ownership and governance. In the future, there is a strong likelihood that the world will be controlled by 12 individuals, owning the governance votes via passive indexing and funds.

This problem is still not solved. And by bringing the system to a digital space, we only intensify it. However, new technology also

brings about new opportunities to solve this problem. Instead of giving the governance power to the 12 individuals, it is possible to distribute the governance to the users who use the system. It is also possible to delegate your governance vote to experts in the area.

The concept is that now we can distribute governance, and people using the system have an active voice in the governance moving forward. No doubt, there will be issues, but this is a positive baby step in the right direction.

3. Incentivising behaviours.

Freeing up the margins that would have gone to the intermediaries and intermediaries, we can now look at redirecting these incentives to encourage certain behaviours.

For example, instead of an expensive listing fee on NASDAQ, listing can be free or with low fees on a decentralised exchange. The fees will be allocated to encourage behaviours, like incentivising users to be liquidity providers and they will be rewarded with the appropriate amount of fees.

This last point is the largest game changer in DeFi. We can now explore new and innovative ways to encourage behaviours, as products and services are now common goods. Instead of the Tragedy of The Commons, we have these incentives in place to encourage Collaborative Commons.

## 14.1.4. Who is in DeFi

DeFi is about decentralisation right? You can imagine a very distributed segment of participants.

Economics and Math of DeFi and Token Engineering

Back to the skyscraper model, this is how it works.

You need the investorsto be funding your commercial skyscraper. You need the architect to design the skyscraper and the blueprint. You need the machineslike cranes to be building them. You need the construction engineersto be using the machines and building the skyscraper according to the blueprint and design. You have the companiesrenting out an office space in the building (e.g. WeWork). You have employeesin the companies using the office space (e.g. members of WeWork).

The value is returned to everyone in the system. Investors with their returns from rental. Architects, engineers and builders with salaries and wages. Companies and employees with a space to work, a network to connect to, and a community to transact with.

In the DeFi model, this is how it works.

Instead of a skyscraper, it is a community with a protocol.

You have investorsto fund the idea of building this. They can be VCs, funds or anyone with capital. You have the architectto design the business logic, incentives and blueprint of how the community, protocol and system works, e.g. Economics Design. You need the machinesto enable this to work. That is the protocol itself, aka code. Instead of construction engineers to build the skyscrapers, there are computer scienceengineersturning the blueprint and design into code. The special part here is that the companiesand employeescan be the same. The companies are retail investors; people with some funds, wanting to invest. The users can also be investors, to be part of the system and use the protocol available.

Summary Table

## 14.1.5. Where is DeFi

DeFi exists digitally, online. Thus, the key consideration is what the jurisdiction is of the various participants (see above).

Regulation is very important, and the regulators are figuring out ways to regulate the space, while the space is innovating with new concepts every single day. It is a very exciting time to be alive.

## 14.1.6 When DeFi Started

You can trace DeFi all the way back to Bitcoin.

216

Economics and Math of DeFi and Token Engineering

Ten years ago, we saw the creation of Bitcoin – a decentralised money. Building upon this asset (decentralised money), we are now at the stage of decentralised finance. Think of your phone and apps. DeFi is the operating system itself (e.g. Android, iOS), and the apps are the various financial protocols that exist on the phone.

The entire system is a huge Lego building block to stack on top of each other. That's where the fun begins.

## 14.2 Nine DeFi 101 FAQ

1. Why is decentralisation important?

Because users like you and me can now take control of the money we use, instead of relying on banks and intermediaries. They are taking a lot of mark-up in this process. We redistribute these mark-ups to users like you and me.

2. What “power” does DeFi bring?

It gives people the ability to create and move money across the world at any given time. It also tries to solve the problem of the unbanked and create more equal access opportunities to users around the world.

3. What’s the difference between DeFi and bitcoin?

Bitcoin is money. It's programmable money. DeFi is the operating system of money. Bitcoin is like the Facebook app, and DeFi is the iOS that your iPhone runs on.

4. Is DeFi a scam?

DeFi is a sub-category in finance. Is finance a scam? It could be and it could not be. It’s difficult to generalise the entire industry into a scam or not. In general, there are real projects working on DeFi and looking to disrupt the existing systems in place. At the same time, there are bad actors cheating money using the system.

5. Why is DeFi important?

As mentioned earlier, decentralisation is the crux of the future. Others are likely to share about financial inclusion and digitisation, so here is the economics perspective instead.

In economics, we have two resources, Labour (L) and Capital (K). In the past (physical and centralised ledger that we covered in Chapter 2), we priced goods based on the hours of labour used to produce them. That is all good, equal and easy.

As we evolved, we started to use machines to enable the completion of tasks. Suddenly, pricing of goods is not just the cost of labour, but the cost of machines. Machines are capital. People who own the machines are capital owners. People with capital are now reaping the profits. People providing the labour are not receiving as much of the profits.

If anything, the world of tomorrow is inching closer towards benefiting capital (K) owners instead of people providing labour (L). Look at technology like GPT-3, machine learning, smart contracts and other forms of automation. These profits will be given to capital owners. Inequality increases when we replace people providing labour (L) with more efficient use of machinery capital (K).

This is where DeFi comes in. It builds a base layer which is an open-source technological stack (K) that is not owned by a single person. Anyone (L) can tap into this capital available to build innovative products and solutions. It becomes accessible and available to everyone and anyone willing to learn.

6. Is DeFi a solution looking for a problem to solve?

Which brings me to the next point that many people ask. Right now, yes, DeFi is a solution looking for a problem to solve. Today, we still live in a predominantly physical world, with an increasing shift towards the digital world.

Right now, we do not have these problems highlighted in #5, because we are not there yet. However, we know we are getting there. Inching closer towards a predominately digital world every day.

Thus, the problem of inequality of capital owners (K) and labour providers (L) will continuously increase. DeFi looks at innovative ways to align incentives of a distributed system. In the end, we can better distribute value amongst users.

The alternative is for capital owners (K) to hoard all profits and the rest of the world bows down to capital owners.

7. How does DeFi have a role in Web 3.0?

Web 3.0 is an open-source collaborative new world that enables both humans and machine intelligence.


Web 1.0 is generally what we call a read-only database. The database creates content and as consumers, we consume it. It’s like a newspaper. We read newspapers and consume the content.

Web 2.0 increases the users on the network. It is a read and write database. That means we can consume the content and also create content. It’s like the newspaper with a forum page or The Economist with letters to the editors.

Web 3.0 brings the web to a new level. It is a read and write database with machine intelligence. It usually talks about machine learning (artificial intelligence), internet of things, robotics and blockchain. 5G network helps Web 3.0 as it allows for more information and data transfer for machine intelligence to work efficiently.


8. Where is the innovation in DeFi?

Most innovation are not absolutely mindblowing. In chapter 13, we dive further into the math of automation in DeFi.

One of the innovations in the space is the use of bonding curves as the core technological stack for these protocols. There are various ways of using bonding curves as discussed in Chapter 11.

What is layer 1 and layer 2?


Layer 1 is the core base layer. Instead of a centralised ledger, we use a distributed ledger (aka blockchain).

Layer 2 are scalability solutions. This is because Layer 1 can be slow sometimes or too costly to send many mini-transactions.

Application layer is usually where most DeFi protocols are. It can be built on Layer 1 or Layer 2. It focuses on producing the solutions to end-users instead of providing the back-end solutions to protocols (Layer 1 and 2).

Box 5: Comparing Traditional Lending with

DeFi Lending

If Adam has $100 and Benny needs to borrow $100, how does that work? If you trust each other, you can just lend directly, and maybe Adam charges an interest rate, let's say 5%.

In the traditional finance space today, you don't know each other. Adam puts the money with the bank. The bank pays Adam some interest. Then the bank uses that money to find people like Benny, who want to borrow, and Benny pays the interest to the bank.

DeFi now replaces the role of the bank and solves the problem of "trust" across the world. Instead of trusting the people, DeFi turns that trust into code in the system. How? (1) money (aka Facebook app) is programmable. And (2) the operating system of money (aka your iOS or Android system) is also programmable.

Now, Adam can find all the Bennys in the world withouthaving to

Trust Benny or know Benny personally

Engage with a bank or third party that will take profits away

Find a centralised institution

DeFi Lending

We are basically programming code into the money (e.g. $TOKEN). And in the code, we incentivise people to put money in or take money out.


How? We do this by changing interest rates.

This will change people’s behaviours by creating loans and to encourage lending or borrowing.

When demand drops, the interest rate drops. People are more likely to demand more $TOKEN now, since it is cheaper.

When demand goes up, there is too much supply. Interest rates increase. People demand less $TOKEN because it’s more expensive now.

The change in interest rate is executed by programs and code.


## 14.3 Economics vs Monetary Value

Tokens are a way to extract the economic value of a ecosystem and to distribute this value directly to the community. In DeFi, tokens to capture the value of the community and redistribute the value. The monetary value comes when tokens with economic value are traded in the secondary market.

In DeFi, where is the economic value coming from? This is similar to Uber when they started. They were paying for users to use their services. They were losing money in every single transaction that the platform processed but it helped to bootstrap the network economy in the long run.

In the marketplace economy, it is always a chicken and egg issue. Without a supplier, you do not attract users to your platform. Without users, suppliers are not incentivised to come. By having a very high reward, you attract both sides i.e. the suppliers and the consumers to come at the same time. Hopefully in the long run, it can grow into a sustainable economy for the protocol.

## 14.4 Where is DeFi’s Economic Value Accrual?

Where is the economic value accrual then? It comes in 3 major areas:

Network effects and Positive Externalities

Collaborative Commons

Interoperable Lego Blocks

### 14.4.1. Network Effects and Positive Externalities

In networked economies, you have value being created in that economy and the positive externalities that come with it.

In economics, a positive externality is additional benefits that affects a third party that did not incur the benefit. For example, in developing a housing market in a rural city, the positive externalities could be improved public healthcare, better local communities and more collaborative commons like weekend markets, libraries and cleaner parks.

#### 14.4.1.1 Example: Vaccines

Think of vaccines. When a person is vaccinated, they are less likely to catch that particular disease. Because they are less likely to catch it, they are less likely to become a carrier and infect others. Getting vaccinated has a positive externality for the community.

#### 14.4.1.2 Example: DeFi and Fiscal Policy

Similarly, native tokens of each DeFi sector are used to capture the economic value in the system. In DeFi the networked

## 14.5 Nine Sectors in DeFi

Finance is a complex market. If you ask someone what they do, and they say finance, you rarely follow up with “which area in finance?”. Whereas in medicine, you would be more likely to ask about the specialisation like gynaecology, paediatrician, cardiothoracic surgeon.


This is because finance is hard and complicated. You have so many sectors and it’s difficult to keep up with them. There are many sectors in finance, but here specifically, we will dive into nine sectors. It gives us enough sectors to have a snapshot of the DeFi environment and understand how they work, according to what we have learnt so far.

The nine sectors we want to look at are currency as a medium of exchange, assets, places to keep these assets, exchanges, lending and borrowing, derivatives, funds and portfolios, insurance, and applications beyond finance.

### 14.5.1 Currency as a Medium of Exchange

Traditional finance’s medium of exchange includes examples like USD, GBP, EUR, JYP, RMB.

These are governed by 12 very brilliant monetary economists in the central bank. They decide the interest rates, define the inflation

Note: if you are in the financial capital market space, please refer to Appendix A for a comparison chart of the terms used in DeFi.
